A simple tutorial js game
You need to protect deers, by killing wolves. Don't kill a DEAR, you will get a penalty!

To run just a http service in the root folder.
For example simple command line server (https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve)

$ npm install -g serve
$ serve

Go to localhost:3000 and have fun :)
